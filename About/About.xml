--- Original Description ---
I saw a reddit post requesting an update mainly for the freezer effect, so here you go.
________________________________________________________________________________

A set of misc mods by Nandonalt. A new save is not required.

"Sometimes I think of small additions to the game that would take too much time to make just one mod for it, so I decided to create a small pack."

These features can be disabled on the mod settings.
Cold Fog and "Ice Layer": when a room goes below 0C temperature, it'll slowly emit a effect that resembles the cold fog present in freezers. Also, a layer of ice will be created just above the floor.

Water puddles: rain will form water puddles on the map which will dry when it's not raining. Water is easily spreaded by pawns. Does not affect anything but cleanliness/beauty of the area that it's on.

Cloudy Weather: new weather overlay, very slightly affects accuracy and wind speed.

Billiard cues: pawns will wield cues when playing billiards.</description>
